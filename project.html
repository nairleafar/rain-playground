        <h2>Deniel Poge was once a powerful Hunter Angel, feared by all dark spirits. But when he broke the rules of heaven to save a human girl, he was punished. His wings burned away, and he fell to earth as a fallen angel.

Even without his angelic power, Deniel continued to fight the shadows that threatened the innocent. Heaven may have cast him out, but he chose his own path — to protect humans no matter the cost.</h2>
